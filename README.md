Introducing a seamless and engaging application experience centered around a single screen. This screen serves as your gateway to a captivating search photos view, elegantly presenting a vertical grid of images arranged in two columns. Utilizing the Flickr image search API (https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photos.search), the app equips itself with a user-friendly search bar for effortless exploration.

The innovation continues with an infinite scroll feature, ensuring that your journey through the imagery remains uninterrupted. As you navigate, the app intuitively loads more content through a pagination system whenever you reach the end of your search results.
